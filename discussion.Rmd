Discussion

The dataset we conclude in this project contains all aspects of questions regarding mental health issues. Using the data and model building process, we find out that family history and the numbers of employees have relationship with existence of mental health disorders. 

The plots in our project shows that people with personality disorder are less likely to actively seek treatment compared to people with post-traumatic stress disorder. The violin plot shows that for all kinds of disorders treatment can improve their mental health situation.

The first limitation of the project is that the data set we include is not large enough. Participants mostly lives in US so we cannot generate the conclusion in global scale. The second limitation of our project is that we fail to test the relationship between gender and mental health status since participants using different kinds of gender-identify strategies.
